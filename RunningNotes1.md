**Sep 15**

Web-based program

each user should be able to log on with a username and password (PID or onyen? if possible)

students view their number of hours; perhaps, the courses responsible

Dr. Felix views a list of the students- most importantly, with their running total of hours (as well as each students' courses? perhaps this is an option to view- aiming for simplicity/minimalism)

the list of the students could have a search engine, asking for "less than or equal to", "equal to", "greater than or equal to" + # of hours. or search for specific names. this is still very vague, but a major possibility.

if the search engine were implemented, perhaps a warning is unnecessary. It is proposed that students, about mid-week, should have a certain number of hours (~20) and if they have less than that number, they might not be able to pass by the end of the week. A warning may automatically appear next to their name at this time.

maintainer will need to be able to edit information, if needed, and to be able to enter new courses for the following year

Set up Apache servers and PHP on the computers

Hanna will be handling interfaces/design aspects

Cameron and Logan will be handling connecting the interface to the database via PHP code

Established crude interface/results page for the student user case. CSS will be applied to it down the line to make it more presentable

Started on the admin user case w/ expandable tables so that viewing individual students/classes will be easier to do

established Schedule v1.0, put it on the wiki site


_(will continue to write notes as information is known)_
